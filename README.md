### Concise Summary of Findings and Learnings from the Project

The project successfully classified faces into two groups by detecting them with a Haar Cascade classifier on grayscale images, extracting average hue and saturation features in HSV color space, and applying K-Means clustering, with results visualized in a scatter plot with centroids. Tools like WandB, GitHub, and Docker supported experiment tracking, version control, and containerization, ensuring an efficient and reproducible workflow. This approach effectively demonstrated the power of combining image processing and clustering techniques for face categorization.
